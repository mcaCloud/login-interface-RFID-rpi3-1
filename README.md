PiMenu
======

This is a simple fullscreen Login screen written in Python TKInter. It uses EM4100 RFID usb reader. Once access is granted it can access to menu based on Pimenu program. This is just a test project and by no means it should be used in production enviroments. It has a lot of testing files , so no all the files are fully fuctional.
